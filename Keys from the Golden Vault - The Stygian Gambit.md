### Afterlife Casino Locations

The casino is divided into nine areas of gaming and entertainment. The north end of the casino ends in an 80-foot rocky cliff face. The river that runs through the casino pours over the cliff at the overlook (area A10) and empties into a larger body of water below.

The following locations are keyed to map 2.2.

#### A1: Docking Area

The casino's boats load and unload passengers at a pair of wooden docks. Two tiefling attendants (**commoners**) help patrons into and out of the boats.

Patrons are expected to abide by the casino's rules, which are posted on placards near the docks. The placards read as follows:

>> ##### Rules in the Afterlife:
>>
>>Stay out of the River Styx.
>>
>>Don't cheat. (Cheaters never prosper.)
>>
>>Don't accost or threaten other patrons or the staff.
>>
>>Keep your weapons hidden or sheathed at all times.
>>
>>Only employees may pass through
>>
>>green-trimmed doors.
>>
>>WIN, WIN, WIN!
>>

#### A2: Avernus

This area holds three-dragon ante tables and copper slot machines. Just south of the game tables are two cashier booths. Just north of the games area is a secluded lounge that holds a small bar as well as chairs and couches.

***Security Mirrors.*** A security mirror hangs in the southeast corner overlooking the games area. Another security mirror hangs on the north wall, above the chairs in the lounge area.

#### A3: Dis

This section contains rows of copper slot machines and five life and death tables, each with a different bet value: 1 cp, 5 cp, 1 sp, 1 gp, and 10 gp.

#### A4: Minauros

>>A narrow racing track dominates the center of this section, with shouting and cheering patrons clustered around it. Numbered rats scurry along their respective lanes. As the rats cross the finish line, cries of victory and groans of defeat erupt from the patrons. Just south of the track are a pair of lounge chairs and two cashier booths staffed by tieflings wearing devil masks.
>>

***Security Mirrors.*** A security mirror overlooks the cashier booths in the southwest corner. Another security mirror hangs in the northwest corner of this area, overlooking the track.

#### A5: Bar Malbolge

Bar Malbolge features two bars and plenty of plush, comfortable chairs and cushions. The tiefling bartenders (**commoners**) serve spirits and a bitter ale called Brimstone Gulp. This ale is served in copper flagons embossed with prancing imps. Patrons can also buy cigars here for 1 cp each.

***Security Mirror.*** A security mirror in the northwest corner of this area faces the northernmost bar and seating area.

#### A6: Phlegethosian Spa & Stygian Baths

>>The air in here is warmer and more humid than in the casino proper and bears a sulfurous fragrance. A tiefling seated behind a desk gives you a warm smile. Chintz curtains are drawn behind her.
>>
>>"Dear souls," says the tiefling. "Care to enjoy a massage, relax in our sauna, or take a warm bath?"
>>

The tiefling attendant (**commoner**) is happy to schedule massages or time in the sauna or baths. Patrons are allowed to explore the areas beyond the curtain:

- **Phlegethosian Spa** The northernmost chamber is where patrons receive therapeutic massages (10 gp for an hour) or relax in the wood-sided sauna for free. A locked double door in the east wall leads to the laundry (area A7).
- **Stygian Baths** The southernmost room contains four steaming pools of water. Patrons can pay 2 gp for two hours in the pools or 5 gp for an all-day pass.

#### A7: Laundry

*Employee-Only Area*

This area holds two large washtubs, as well as a clothesline hung with towels and employee uniforms. Characters who want to disguise themselves as employees can find plenty of uniforms here.

#### A8: Cirque Maladomini

Cirque Maladomini performs here for the enjoyment of all. Hour-long performances occur here once every four hours. Each show presents a mix of tiefling acrobats and trained animals, all performing to the music of a tiefling banjo player. The star of the show is a trained lion named Emrys, which leaps through flaming hoops on command. See area A12 for more information about these creatures.

Casino patrons come and go through two sets of double doors in the east wall. Descending rings of seats encircle a 35-foot-wide, 10-foot-deep depression in the floor. When the circus is in full swing, performers and trained animals enter and leave through an open tunnel in the west wall of the depression. This tunnel leads to a staging area (area A12) behind a locked double door.

***Security Mirror.*** A security mirror hangs in the northwest corner, overlooking the seating area.

#### A9: Cania

>>Steps lead to the sunken floor of a gambling haven ringed with pillars of black basalt. Seven three-dragon ante tables take up the floorspace. A three-foot-high shelf carved into the far wall bears a glass case, displayed in which is a gold statuette of a winged devil. Standing next to the display case is a tiefling security guard.
>>

The five tables closest to the entrance are high-stakes tables (50 gp buy-in) open to anyone, while the easternmost two tables are reserved for the final rounds of the Grand Minauros Invitational tournament.

***Grand Minauros Invitational.*** When the characters first arrive here, the tournament is in full swing. Its eight remaining participants (see the "Tournament Participants" sidebar) are arranged as shown in the Tournament Seating table. Between rounds of the tournament, characters are free to mingle and chat with the tournament participants.

#### Tournament Seating

> ##### Tournament Participants
>
>Eight card sharks have come to participate in the Grand Minauros Invitational tournament. Use the **noble** stat block to represent them, but assume they are unarmed and unarmored. Their names and descriptions are as follows:
>
>**Anaïs Bellefleur** (chaotic good tiefling) smokes foul-smelling cigars, has a bellowing laugh, and enjoys ale a bit too much.
>
>**Jetta Moore** (neutral good human) has childlike enthusiasm and displays guileless naiveté.
>
>**Karn Ironpebble** (lawful neutral dwarf) grumbles to himself, counts cards, and is deliberately slow at playing his hands.
>
>**Lahdia Mizreem** (neutral drow) is aloof, inscrutable, and fiercely determined to win.
>
>**Nightshade** (lawful good tiefling) finds the theme of the casino distasteful but is willing to overlook it to win the purse.
>
>**Ruthie Swifford** (neutral good human) is a determined, no-nonsense player who keeps up a constant stream of good-natured chatter.
>
>**Whipp Walsh** (chaotic neutral human) is a charming rake and a sore loser.
>
>**Wumpus Thistledown** (lawful evil halfling) dislikes playing high bets and is condescending.
>
>Barring character intervention, the tournament participants are eliminated in the following order: Wumpus Thistledown, Anaïs Bellefleur, Whipp Walsh, Jetta Moore, Karn Ironpebble, Nightshade, and Ruthie Swifford. That leaves Lahdia Mizreem as the winner.
>

***Security Guard and Display Case.*** A tiefling security guard (use the **thug** stat block) stands next to the display case and allows guests to examine the statuette without touching the case.

The display case is 2 feet wide, 2 feet deep, and 3 feet tall, and it weighs 25 pounds. It is a Small object that has AC 13, 3 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. The erinyes statuette is a Tiny object that weighs 9 pounds.

A character who examines the display case and succeeds on a DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) check spots a line of barely visible runes inscribed around the perimeter of each pane of glass. A *detect magic* spell reveals an aura of abjuration magic emanating from these runes. Damaging the case triggers a magical trap that forces each creature in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on the case to succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute.

The front of the display case is a hinged door with a locked latch. The door can be unlocked and opened using the key found in Quentin's office (area A14). As an action, a character using thieves' tools can try to pick the lock, doing so with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check.

***Security Mirror.*** A security mirror hangs on a pillar in the southwest corner, overlooking the room.

#### A10: Waterfall Overlook

>>The casino floor ends where the river spills over the edge of a cliff and into a much larger body of water. The waterfall is thunderous, drowning out the noise from the casino. Above the waterfall is a stone overlook bounded by three-foot-high railings.
>>

The waterfall is 100 feet tall and plunges into water that is 30 feet deep.

***Security Mirror.*** A security mirror is mounted in the northeast corner, overlooking the area.

#### A11: Nessus

Nessus is a restaurant located 20 feet below the casino. It can be reached by descending a spiral staircase in the hallway between areas A6 and A9.

The restaurant's dining area sits on a ledge behind the waterfall (area A10). The ceiling here is uneven but is roughly 12 feet high. A smooth wall separates the dining area from the kitchen, which contains two large stoves.

The restaurant is open all day and offers the following menu of options:

>> ##### Nessus—Menu
>>
>>Appetizers
>>
>>Seasonal pan-fried fungi with garlic butter • 2 cp
>>
>>Spicy shredded stirge sliders • 3 cp
>>
>>Main Dishes
>>
>>Abyssal chicken egg omelet • 1 sp
>>
>>Otto's irresistible noodles • 5 cp
>>
>>Otyugh steak, well done • 3 sp
>>
>>Desserts & Drinks
>>
>>Night hag's delight (blackberry tart) • 2 cp
>>
>>Stench kow cheese plate • 2 cp
>>
>>Nessian liqueur • 2 cp
>>
>>Coffee/tea • 1 cp (first cup is complimentary!)
>>

***Security Mirror.*** A security mirror hangs on the southeast wall, just north of the entry tunnel, overlooking the dining room.

#### A12: Staging Area and Animal Cages

*Employee-Only Area*

Cirque Maladomini uses this room as a holding pen for animals and a staging area for performers. Characters entering from the south must descend a flight of steps to reach the chamber's sunken floor.

When the characters enter this room for the first time, read the following:

>>This room smells like hay and musk. Three crates rest on the floor in one corner, and a portable cage on rollers sits beside them. Floor-to-ceiling bars form two larger cages against the north wall. A wooden chest sits against the east wall near the biggest cage. Resting on the lid of the chest is a ring of keys.
>>

A locked double door in the middle of the east wall conceals a curvy tunnel that leads to area A8.

When Cirque Maladomini isn't performing in area A8, the northwest cage holds three trained **baboons** that shriek whenever someone new enters the room, and the northeast cage contains a quiet trained **lion** named Emrys. Three tiefling acrobats (**commoners** with Acrobatics +4 and Performance +4) are also rehearsing together in the middle of the room. One tiefling performs a one-handed handstand, while another twirls a flaming hoop, and the third plucks a banjo. During performances, the tieflings and the animals are all absent.

***Wooden Chest.*** The wooden chest next to the lion's cage is unlocked. The keys on the chest unlock the doors to the animal cages. The chest itself contains juggling pins, rubber balls, colorful streamers, and other circus doodads. A *potion of animal friendship* can be found here as well.

#### A13: Employee Lounge

*Employee-Only Area*

>>This room is sixty feet long by fifty feet wide. A long table surrounded by ten chairs takes up the center of the room, and the far corners each hold a couch, two cushioned chairs, and a coffee table.
>>

At any time during casino hours, three tiefling employees (**commoners**) are here on a break.

The off-duty employees are chatty and not overly fond of their employer. Characters who question the tieflings can learn the following information:

- **Minotaur Skeleton** Quentin recently added a new security measure to the casino's vault: an animated minotaur skeleton. Quentin refers to it as "Virgil." It can be controlled using a magic rod that Quentin keeps in his office (area A14).
- **Security Office Personnel** Three guards staff the security office across the hall.

#### A14: Quentin's Office

*Employee-Only Area*

>>This roomy office contains an L-shaped desk sized for a gnome, cushioned chairs, and knickknacks on shelves. A painted bas-relief spans the entire north wall and depicts a host of winged devils catching mortals as they plunge into the depths of hell.
>>

If Quentin Togglepocket is in his office and notices one or more of the characters, add the following:

>>A garishly dressed gnome with a devilish countenance to rival Mephistopheles sits behind the desk, stroking his pointy beard. When he notices you, he curls his lips in a lopsided smile. "Well, now," he says. "What can I do for you?"
>>

Quentin (lawful evil, gnome **noble**) shrewdly shuns combat, but he draws his rapier and defends himself if threatened and cornered. As an action, he can utter a prayer to Mammon, which causes two **spined devils** to magically emerge from the bas-relief on the north wall. Each devil appears in an unoccupied space next to the north wall, acts as Quentin's ally, and sticks around for 1 minute before returning to the Minauros, the third layer of the Nine Hells. If the devils are defeated, Quentin shouts for help, attracting the three security guards from area A16 if they haven't already been dealt with.

***Ain't Foolin' No One.*** Quentin personally hires all casino staff and knows all their names. Consequently, he isn't fooled by characters pretending to be employees he doesn't know.

***Quentin's Counteroffer.*** If the characters come clean to Quentin, he is amused to hear that Verity hired them to rob his casino. He refuses to give the characters what they came for, instead offering to pay them 150 gp each to forgo the heist and return to Verity with a letter from him.

If the characters agree to his terms, Quentin writes a quick letter, slides it into an envelope, and hands it to them with their payment before leading them back to the casino floor. In addition, he gives each of them a handful of casino chips equivalent to 15 gp.

Quentin's letter to Verity reads as follows:

>>It is such a disappointment when one attempts to conceal their lack of skill by sending others to do their dirty work. Nevertheless, after all this time, it appears I am, in fact, better than you.—Q.
>>

***Desk Drawers.*** The top drawer of Quentin's desk holds a red candle, a quill, a jar of ink, a few sheets of parchment, a few envelopes, a tiny glass key that unlocks the display case in area A9, a copper ring bearing Quentin's wax seal, and a velvet pouch containing 25 gp.

The bottom drawer of Quentin's desk contains an unlocked wooden case that contains a 12-inch-long rod made of bone with a stylized copper minotaur head mounted at each end of it. A *detect magic* spell reveals an aura of enchantment magic emanating from the rod. As an action, the holder of the rod can use it to telepathically command the minotaur skeleton in area A19, provided the rod is within 30 feet of it. The minotaur skeleton follows such commands to the best of its ability. If the minotaur skeleton ever leaves the casino, it goes berserk and can't be controlled by anyone, and the rod turns to dust.

***Treasure.*** Quentin wears nine gem-inlaid gold rings (100 gp each) on his fingers and keeps an employee pass card in his waistcoat pocket (see "Employee Pass Cards" earlier in the adventure).

#### A15: Clerk's Office

*Employee-Only Area*

>>This office contains an L-shaped desk, atop which sits a candlestick and a thick, open ledger. Other furnishings include cushioned chairs and two bare bookshelves.
>>

The ledger on the desk magically tracks all money moving in and out of the casino. Every coin and chip that passes through the cashier booths is recorded here in the appropriate column, scrawled in ink as if by some invisible hand. Any character who spends 1 minute reading the ledger can verify that the casino's vault contains roughly 5,000 gp in coinage.

#### A16: Security Office

*Employee-Only Area*

Five desks face the west wall, which is covered with mirrors. Each mirror on the wall corresponds to a security mirror elsewhere in the casino, and whatever is happening within line of sight of the mirrors is displayed here. Three tiefling security guards (**thugs**) monitor the mirrors.

***Ring of Keys.*** A ring of eight keys dangles from a hook next to the south door. Each cell and chest in area A17 has a corresponding key that unlocks it.

#### A17: Holding Cells

*Employee-Only Area*

This area holds six jail cells and two padlocked wooden chests (see "Wooden Chests" below). The keys in the security office (area A16) unlock the cells and the chests. As an action, a character using thieves' tools can try to pick a lock, doing so with a successful DC 17 Dexterity check. If the character tries to pick the lock of a cell door from inside the cell, the check is made with disadvantage.

***Wooden Chests.*** Both chests are unlocked and empty. If one or more characters are detained here, their weapons are locked in the chests for safekeeping.

#### A18: Back Hallways

*Employee-Only Area*

These three hallways are used frequently by casino employees. At your discretion, characters who linger here might encounter one or more of these employees heading to or from the casino floor.

***Security Mirrors.*** Each hallway has a security mirror on its west wall that faces a single or double door to the east.

#### A19: Vault

*Employee-Only Area*

The double door leading to the vault has cast-iron devil faces mounted on its south side. If a creature without an employee pass card comes within 10 feet of the double door, the devil faces open their mouths and breathe a 10-foot-wide, 30-foot-long line of fire down the hallway. Each creature in the line must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This trap resets at the next dawn.

When the characters peer into the vault for the first time, read the following:

>>The vault is forty feet deep and almost twice as wide. A security mirror stares back at you from the far wall. Seven treasure chests rest on low tables positioned against the north and east walls, and two tall wardrobes stand against the south wall.
>>
>>Standing in the middle of the room is the animated skeleton of a minotaur.
>>

Virgil the **minotaur skeleton** stands guard in the center of the room. Virgil attacks any intruders who aren't escorted by Quentin. A character who has Quentin's magic rod (see area A14) can use it to telepathically command Virgil.

***Iron Chests.*** A *detect magic* spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic around each iron chest. All seven chests are magically linked to the cashier stations in the casino. The interior of each chest's lid is scribed with a rune that enables the cashiers to remotely deposit coins into and withdraw coins from the chests. The chests must be closed for their magic to function, and the chests become nonmagical if removed from the vault.

At any given time, the seven chests contain mixed coinage worth a total of 2d4 × 1,000 gp.

If all the coins are removed from the chests, the cashiers quickly discover they are unable to withdraw money from the vault and alert the guards immediately. It's only a matter of time until someone investigates.

***Security Mirror.*** A security mirror hangs on the north wall of the vault, facing the double door.

***Wardrobes.*** The wardrobes hold items of value given by rich patrons for collateral against the house: a gold and ruby necklace (250 gp), a jade rabbit figurine (75 gp), and a *+1 rapier*.
